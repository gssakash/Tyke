  Tyke is a product with an outstanding User Interface which consists of products stacked on top of each other like cards. It allows the user to swipe right for their favourite products and left for the products they aren't looking for to get their personalised recommendation. 
</p>

## Setup of the Project
* Clone this repository.
* cd `Tyke`.
* Run `npm install`.

## Features
* Personalized feel (NFT) - Swiping cards provides them the same feeling as browsing through the closet, giving them a personal touch.

* Fun - This entire process is enjoyable, which differs from the conventional method of shopping.
